					## Vision

					[insert Why, How, What graphic]

					I inspire meaning in people’s lives by empowering them to recognize, focus on and progress in the things important to them. I build web and mobile applications that give people strategies and tools to pursue what is personally meaningful.

					#### Meaning is not understood. It is felt.
					Meaning is a feeling. An emotion. It’s something we may not understand, but we know when we have found it. Sometimes it’s also called purpose, value or significance. We can find meaning in relationships, ideas, activities, goals and objects.

					#### Meaning Isn't Always a Happy Experience
					Meaning is a key ingredient to feeling happy, but feelings of happiness aren’t always accompanied by it. Sometimes meaning allows us to more fully experience grief or stress.

					#### Meaning Leads to Contentment
					Even when specific feelings that accompany meaning aren't positive, they can contribute to a life that is positive overall. When we recognize and embrace what is meaningful to us it creates a profound sense of presence in our lives that leads to contentment.


					### Finding Meaning
					When we recognize meaning we can focus our energy on it and progress towards our embracing or achievement of  it.

					#### Recognize Meaning
					We don’t have to understand why or how something is meaningful, but we must recognize that it is meaningful. We may find meaning in a relationship with a loved one or playing a sport.

					**But finding meaning isn’t always straightforward.**

					I once had a job in which I found a great deal of meaning in the work, but it wasn’t until I burned out that I discovered it wasn’t the the work that was meaningful. It was the outcome of the work and the relationships I built doing it. These distinctions are significant. They enable us to decide where to focus our energy.

					#### Focus on Meaning
					Our environment is distracting. We reach for our email as soon as we roll out of bed. We work long hours without breaks. We are not present in our lives and we lose sight of what is meaningful.

					**We have limited energy. Focus enables us to use that energy on what’s important.**

					Once we recognize what is meaningful, we must learn to focus on it. We must remove distractions. We must prioritize our time based on what impacts what we believe to be meaningful rather than reacting to what feels immediate.

					#### Progress Towards Meaning
					Progress is how we measure the result of our efforts towards what we believe is meaningful. When we recognize what is meaningful and focus on it we expend our energy effectively. We progress on the things we care about. Even in the most dire of circumstances if we see progress it gives meaning to our struggle and inspires us to persevere.

					### Meaning in Product Development
					It is not enough to build a good product. In order to create businesses that are sustainable we must recognize what our employees, customers and community deem important. Then, because these audiences are meaningful to us, we must genuinely contribute to and care about what is meaningful to them.

					In the words of [Simon Sinek](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action "Simon Sinek: How Great Leaders Inspire Action"), “People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it.” This is becoming especially true among the Millenial generation. 

					Millenials are increasingly placing a great deal of meaning in social good. TOMS, Product (RED) and Warby Parker are just a few examples of Millenials buying what they believe in. A study by Cone Communications found that 89 percent of consumers are very or somewhat likely to switch brands to one that is associated with a good cause, given similar price and quality.
