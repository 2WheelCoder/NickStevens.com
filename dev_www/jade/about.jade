					### Background

					I am driven to inspire focus, productivity and meaning in people&rsquo;s lives because I believe these are a source of happiness. I do this by researching people&rsquo;s problems and then designing and building teams, strategies and tools to solve these problems.

					Today, I solve problems as a User Interface Developer and User Experience Designer of web and mobile apps, but the first problem I took on was extreme poverty.

					In high school I was a tunnel-visioned guitar player with nothing but music on my brain. When I could no longer play guitar after being diagnosed with tendonitis in both hands, I suddenly found myself with a lot of free time. During this time, I read a book about Bono and I was astounded to learn that more than a billion people live in extreme poverty.

					Fast forward to my first week of school at Webster University. Donning a cowboy hat and sunglasses, much like my hero Bono, I marched into the student activities office and asked to speak to the director. I don&rsquo;t know how he took me seriously, but he approved my request to start a student chapter of the ONE Campaign, an organization founded by Bono with the mission to end extreme poverty.

					Over the next five years I built teams, tools and strategies  designed to end extreme poverty. This journey moved me from St. Louis to DC to Geneva, Switzerland to Colorado. I gave Obama a ONE t-shirt, met several US Senators and stood on stage with U2 in front of 40,000 people. Though extreme poverty still exists, our efforts at ONE have contributed to more than 7.5 million people getting access to life-saving AIDS medication and cutting Malaria by more than 75 percent in eight countries.

					I am proud of my work with ONE, but in 2010 after managing ONE&rsquo;s Colorado operation for the US Senate elections I was burnt out. I took a six month sabbatical. After several years of living the transient lifestyle I settled down in Denver&rsquo;s Capitol Hill neighborhood. During the days I learned the value of living in a community and building relationships. During the nights I stayed up late teaching myself to code.

					Rested and re-skilled, I returned to work for a small startup lifestyle magazine called The Hooch Life. I worked with an incredible team of designers, writers and bartenders to create an online magazine for the craft spirits industry. I started by leveraging my political and community organizing background to build a marketing strategy for the brand. However, being the only staff member who knew code, as we moved towards the build phase of the product it fell to me to build the site. I was thrilled and incredibly overwhelmed. But with the help of a very talented product team and a lot of late nights, we launched in December of 2011.

					We launched nearly fifty issues of The Hooch Life, but after our dream to turn the brand into an online store for craft spirits were crushed by the realities of government regulation on alcohol sales and distribution, we closed our doors.

					For the next year I ran my own consulting business helping digital agencies in the Denver/Boulder area build web sites for brands such as Nike and DaVita Healthcare. Though I enjoyed web development, I was growing tired of marketing. I wanted to build products with a purpose.

					So, in 2013 I joined BDW&rsquo;s sixth cohort, a group of 20 graduate students who would learn product design and development by Colorado&rsquo;s best designers, developers and strategists. We worked on real projects for companies around the US and built our own products. I threw myself into human-centered design, beefed up my dev skills and, one day during a caffeine induced walk home, learned to articulate the why, how and what of everything I do:

					_I am driven to inspire focus, progress and meaning in people&rsquo;s lives because I believe these are the source of happiness. I do this by researching people&rsquo;s problems and then designing and building teams, strategies and tools to solve these problems._

					Today, I do this as a designer and developer of web and mobile apps. Recently, I cofounded [Cue](http://cueapp.co "Cue"), a mobile app that introduces you to new people nearby who share your interests. In addition, I work with startups and agencies to help them bring focus, productivity and meaning to their products, ultimately contributing to customer satisfaction, loyalty and I believe, a better world.
